\abstract{Quasi-Monte Carlo (qMC) theory has developed over than six decades.  Computer implementations of quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms have followed behind.  With practitioners seeking ways to speed up their Monte Carlo calculations, and theorists eager to see qMC expand into new application areas, we need qMC software that is reliable, efficient, accessible, comprehensive, and easy-to-use.  This talk describes the progress that has been made so far by various groups and what challenges lie ahead.
